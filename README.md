# Cluster Analysis Readme

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cluster Analysis project! In this guide, you will learn how to implement clusters to segment different groups based on shared features and measure the robustness of the solution. Rather than including screenshots of plain code and describing functions, we will walk through the overall process, how to interpret results, and test the solution.

## Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your R environment:
- `readxl`
- `psych`
- `ggplot2`
- `gmodels`
- `vcd`
- `varhandle`
- `factoextra`
- `dplyr`
- `fpc`

You can install these libraries by running the following code:
```R
packs <- c('readxl', 'psych', 'ggplot2', 'gmodels', 'vcd', 'varhandle', 'factoextra', 'dplyr', 'fpc')
if (!require(packs)) 
  install.packages(packs)
```

## Data
The data used in this project is stored in `lite_dataS.xlsx`.

## Getting Started
To begin, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries as mentioned above.
3. Load the dataset `lite_dataS.xlsx` into your R environment.
4. Proceed with the instructions provided in the main script files.

## Structure
- `cluster_analysis.R`: Main script file containing the implementation of cluster analysis.
- `utils.R`: Utility functions used in the analysis.
- `lite_dataS.xlsx`: Dataset used for clustering.

## Usage
Follow the instructions within the script files to perform cluster analysis. Make sure to read through the comments and documentation provided in the code to understand each step thoroughly.
